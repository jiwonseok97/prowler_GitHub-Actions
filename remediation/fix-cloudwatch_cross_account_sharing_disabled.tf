The provided Terraform code does the following:

1. Configures the AWS provider for the `ap-northeast-2` region.
2. Retrieves the existing CloudWatch log group using the `data` source.
3. Creates a CloudWatch log subscription filter to restrict cross-account sharing of the log group. The `role_arn` parameter is set to the specified value, and the `destination_arn` parameter is set to a specific destination ARN.
